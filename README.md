# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This is a simple example of a CRUD web app, with a database hosted in AWS, and a configured API Gateway
endpoint that triggers a lambda which runs the required code to either update, remove, or add to the database.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

Tests were not made, and the folder was deleted as I did not believe tests were
needed for this project.

## Sources and Credits

I simply used my html and css skills!
